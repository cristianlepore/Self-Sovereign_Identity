# Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity

The definitions of principles from the 18 studies are presented below. Each definition has been directly extracted from the original papers to provide an accurate representation of the principle as described by the authors.

| Property | Definition |
|----------|----------|
| Existence and Representation | - A self-sovereign identity must enable a user to encode her characteristics digitally to assert her existence in the digital domain. This essentially is a quasi-representation of one’s self in digital form.[^ferdous] <br>- Users must have an independent existence.[^sheldrake][^stokkink] They should be able to create as many identities as required without the intervention of a third party.[^cucko]<br>- Users must have an independent existence. Any self-sovereign identity is ultimately based on the ineffable “I” that’s at the heart of identity. It can never exist wholly in digital form. This must be the kernel of self that is upheld and supported. A self-sovereign identity simply makes public and accessible some limited aspects of the “I” that already exists.[^allen][^tobin]<br>- An SSI ecosystem shall provide the means for any entity - human, legal, natural, physical or digital - to be represented by any number of digital identities.[^toip][^sovrin]<br>- Prioritizing the existence of a person over the digital representation of their identities, ensuring independence.[^pava] |
| Ownership and Control | - User must be the ultimate owner of a self-sovereign identity. This applies to any information encoding the identity, including the claims, whether it is self-asserted or provided by a third party.[^ferdous][^muhle]<br>- Self‐sovereign identities are controlled by the individual.[^andrieu] Subject to well-understood and secure algorithms that ensure the continued validity of an identity and its claims, the user is the ultimate authority on their identity. They should always be able to refer to it, update it, or even hide it. They must be able to choose celebrity or privacy as they prefer. This doesn’t mean that a user controls all of the claims on their identity: other users may make claims about a user, but they should not be central to the identity itself.[^allen]<br>- Any identity and its associated personal and confidential data should be owned and controlled by the identity owner, leading to the introduction of the concept of a Digital Wallet, keeping all identity related personal and confidential data on the device which is normally owned and controlled by the identity owner.[^naik]<br>- Users must control their identity.[^sheldrake]<br>- Owners in the digital world should be able to control and access their digital identities to interact with other parties.[^toth]<br>- The identity of a subject is owned, and hence controlled, by the party.[^essif]<br>- An SSI ecosystem shall empower entities who have natural, human, or legal rights in relation to their identity (“Identity Rights Holders”) to control usage of their digital identity data and exert this control by employing and/or delegating to agents and guardians of their choice, including individuals, organizations, devices, and software.[^toip]<br>- Affirming that users have sole control over their information and full authority over their identities.[^pava]<br>- Users must control their identities. Users should always be able to refer to it, update it and access their own data.[^satybaldy]<br>- Users must control their identities.[^stokkink] They should be able to control the usage/sharing of their identity data.[^cucko] |
| Access and Availability | - A user must have unrestricted access to her identity information. She must be able to retrieve every single piece of information, including claims and assertions which constitute her identity.[^ferdous]<br>- Any identity related solution and services should be user friendly and accessible by as many people as possible. [...] Any identity related solutions and services should be available to all without any discrimination based on their ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, or language.[^naik]<br>- Users must have access to their own data.[^sheldrake]<br>- A self-sovereign identity makes public and accessible some limited aspects of an individual’s identity.[^toth]<br>- An SSI ecosystem shall maximize usability and accessibility of agents and other SSI components for identity rights holders, including consistency of user experience.[^toip][^sovrin]<br>- Beyond a few critical special cases, access to systems and data should not depend on employees’ location or device, allowing tasks to be completed at all times and from different places.[^glockler]<br>- Ensuring entities always have direct and unrestricted access to their identity attributes and knowledge of any queries made about their identities.[^pava]<br>- Users must have access to their own data.[^stokkink] A user must always be able to easily retrieve all the claims and other data within his identity. [...] Users have access to their own data.[^allen] |
| Transparency | - Self-sovereign identity and its system must be transparent enough for every involved entity. A user should be well aware about all her partial identities and their corresponding interactions.[^ferdous]<br>- All systems, protocols and algorithms employed in any identity solution should be free, open-source, and as independent as possible of any particular architecture or proprietorship.[^naik]<br>- An SSI ecosystem shall empower identity rights holders and all other stakeholders to easily access and verify information necessary to understand the incentives, rules, policies, and algorithms under which agents and other components of SSI ecosystems operate.[^toip][^sovrin]<br>- Advocating for open-source algorithms and systems for digital identity management that are free from licensing restrictions. This will enable public validation of these systems by software developers.[^pava]<br>- Systems and protocols must be transparent. The systems used to administer and operate a network of identities must be open, both in how they function and in how they are managed and how they are updated. The algorithms should be free, well-known and architecture independent.[^satybaldy]<br>- Systems and algorithms must be transparent.[^stokkink] The systems used to administer and operate a network of identities must be open, both in how they function and in how they are managed and updated. The algorithms should be free, open-source, well-known, and as independent as possible of any particular architecture; anyone should be able to examine how they work.[^allen] |
| Persistence | - A self-sovereign identity must be persistent, at least as long as it is required by its owner. For third party claims, they must be persistent until the asserted authority ceases to exist.[^ferdous]<br>- Identities must be long-lived.[^sheldrake][^stokkink] Preferably, identities should last forever, or at least for as long as the user wishes. Though private keys might need to be rotated and data might need to be changed, the identity remains. [...] Identities should last until they’ve been outdated by newer identity systems. This must not contradict a “right to be forgotten”; a user should be able to dispose of an identity if he wishes and claims should be modified or removed as appropriate over time. [...][^allen]<br>- Ensuring that identities endure for as long as needed by the owner.[^pava]<br>- Identities must be long-lived and preferably last for as long as the identity owner wishes; a user must have a right to be forgotten, which means, ability to remove some of the operational data from the SSI system.[^satybaldy][^cucko] |
| Portability | - A self-sovereign identity must be portable. This will ensure that a user’s partial identity can be transferred to a medium or platform when the previous medium or platform disappears form the landscape due to a variety of reasons.[^ferdous]<br>- An identity and its associated data should be easily transportable from one platform to another platform.[^naik]<br>- An SSI ecosystem shall not restrict the ability of identity rights holders to move or transfer a copy of their digital identity data to the agents or systems of their choice.[^toip][^sovrin]<br>- Allowing users to move or transport their identity without legal, political, or technological restrictions, ensuring control in unforeseen events or disasters.[^pava]<br>- Personal information and services about identity must be transportable. Transportable identities ensure that the user remains in control of his identity and can also improve an identity’s persistence over time.[...] [^satybaldy]<br>- Information and services about identity must be transportable.[^stokkink] Identities must not be held by a singular third-party entity, even if it’s a trusted entity that is expected to work in the best interest of the user. [...] Transportable identities ensure that the user remains in control of his identity no matter what [...].[^allen] |
| Interoperability | - A self-sovereign identity must be designed in such a way that it can achieve the maximum level of interoperability. It must also ensure that it is backward compatible with legacy identity systems for a period of time to ensure a smoother interaction between those systems and a self-sovereign system.[^ferdous]<br>- Two different identity solutions should be capable of communicating with each other at scale. This will enable enterprises and government organisations to communicate with each other irrespective of their employed identity solutions.[^naik]<br>- Owners and providers must be able to use their digital identities to reliably and securely interact with each other over the web. Effective interoperability ensures that users and providers can correspond by way of the identity data model’s APIs using collaborative web services, such as email, text messaging, and conferencing. Interoperability across the Internet must necessarily leverage the web’s transport layer protocols.[^toth]<br>- An SSI ecosystem shall enable digital identity data for an entity to be represented, exchanged, secured, protected, and verified interoperably using open, public, and royalty-free standards.[^toip][^sovrin]<br>- Enabling users to use their digital identities across multiple scenarios or systems globally without losing control.[^pava]<br>- Identities should be as widely usable as possible. The SSI system should enable global identities which could cross international boundaries and various system implementations. Transportable identity is sometimes mentioned as a requirement to be fulfilled.[^satybaldy]<br>- Identities should be as widely usable as possible.[^stokkink] Identities are of little value if they only work in limited niches. The goal of a 21st-century digital identity system is to make identity information widely available, crossing international boundaries to create global identities, without losing user control.[^allen][^cucko] |
| Consent | - Every single piece of identity data must be released to a third party only after the corresponding user  has consented to do so.[^ferdous]<br>- Individuals should be able to give consent and disclose just enough private information to satisfy the needs of relying parties.[^toth]<br>- Granting users the power to allow or deny access to their data.[^pava]<br>- Sharing of personal data must only occur with the consent of the identity owner.[^satybaldy]<br>- Users must agree to the use of their identity.[^stokkink]<br>- [...] Sharing of data must only occur with the consent of the user. Though other users such as an employer, a credit bureau, or a friend might present claims, the user must still offer consent for them to become valid. Note that this consent might not be interactive, but it must still be deliberate and well-understood.[^allen] |
| Security and Protection | - Self-sovereign identity should be well protected with latest cryptographic mechanisms satisfying the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Authenticity) and non-repudiation properties. Any identity information must be stored in a secure manner and transmitted via a secure channel.[^ferdous]<br>- An SSI ecosystem shall empower identity rights holders to secure their digital identity data at rest and in motion, to control their own identifiers and encryption keys, and to employ end-to-end encryption for all interactions.[^toip][^sovrin]<br>- Prioritizing censorship-resistant systems that promote individual rights and freedom in decentralized environments.[^pava]<br>- The rights of users must be protected on the protocol level.[^satybaldy]<br>- The rights of users must be protected.[^stokkink] When there is a conflict between the needs of the identity network and the rights of individual users, then the network should lean on the side of preserving the freedoms and rights of the individuals over the needs of the network. To ensure this, identity authentication must occur through independent algorithms that are censorship-resistant and force-resilient and that are run in a decentralized manner.[^allen]|
| Privacy and Minimal Disclosure | - The disclosure of identity must be minimized as much as possible. Such identity must be flexible enough to ensure a user can achieve her desired goal by leveraging the minimum amount of identity data.[^ferdous]<br>- As the user controlled identity demands transparent flow of data, identity management infrastructure should be designed to support pseudonymity while maintaining required degrees of confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, nonrepudiation and robustness.[^gilani]<br>- Individuals should be able to use services with minimal identity information. Features that depend on enhanced correlation must be understood by the average user. Such features should be permissioned with the highest granularity, so functions independent of correlation work equally well alongside those dependent on it. It is not acceptable to deny services because of a refusal to provide unrelated information.[^andrieu]<br>- As an aim, any identity owner should only be requested to provide or disclose the minimum identity information required for verification or service while maintaining as much anonymity as possible. The SSI solution should not provide any mechanism to correlate biometric data with an underlying identity.[^naik]<br>- An SSI ecosystem shall empower identity rights holders to protect the privacy of their digital identity data and to share the minimum digital identity data required for any particular interaction.[^toip][^sovrin]<br>- Allowing users to selectively disclose their identity attributes.[^pava]<br>- The users must be able to choose their privacy model. In order to support users’ privacy, disclosure of claims must be minimized. When personal data is disclosed, that disclosure should involve the minimum amount of information necessary to accomplish the task at hand.[^satybaldy]<br>- Disclosure of claims must be minimized.[^stokkink] When data is disclosed, that disclosure should involve the minimum amount of data necessary to accomplish the task at hand. [...] This principle can be supported with selective disclosure, range proofs, and other zero-knowledge techniques, but non-correlatibility is still a very hard (perhaps impossible) task; the best we can do is to use minimalization to support privacy as best as possible.[^allen]<br>- Individuals should be able to protect their privacy by utilizing selective disclosure and data minimization.[^cucko] |
| Standard | - A self-sovereign identity must be based on open standards to ensure maximum portability, interoperability and adoption as well as sustainability.[^ferdous]<br>- Identities must be based on open Standards to ensure maximal portability, interoperability, and persistence. Entities should be represented, exchanged, secured, protected, and verified using open, public, and royalty-free Standards.[^cucko][^BlockTechDiVer] | 
| Cost | - The cost to create, manage and adopt a self-sovereign identity must be as minimum as possible. Otherwise it will create an unnecessary hindrance towards its wide-scale adoption.[^ferdous]<br>- An identity should be offered to general users free of cost and it should not incur any hidden cost, licensing fees, or any other financial charges for simply owning an identity. However, this may not apply to costs related to other resources and implementations.[^naik]<br>- [...] Reducing costs, for instance, for IT help desks.[^glockler]<br>- The cost of identity creation, management, and adoption should be minimized. The benefits of SSI must sustantially outweigh the costs, otherwise, adoption might be hundered.[^cucko] |
| Usability and Consistency | - Sovereign identities must be robust enough to be recovered even if hard drives are lost, wallets stolen, or birth certificates lost in a fire. Self‐sovereign identities must provide a way for individuals to recover and reassert that existing identify information applies to them even in the face of complete loss of credentials.[^andrieu]<br>- The identity solution should be sufficiently resilient to successfully recover any identity in the event of a lost key, lost wallet or lost mobile/device. It should offer a number of mechanisms to identity owners to recover and reassert their identity in the event of a complete loss of credentials.[^naik]<br>- Owners must be able to intuitively and reliably control, manage, and use their self-sovereign digital identities as well as the digital identities of collaborating parties.[^toth]<br>- An SSI ecosystem shall maximize usability and accessibility of agents and other SSI components for identity rights holders, including consistency of user experience.[^sovrin]<br>- The user experience must be consistent with user needs and expectations. Identity owners must be able to count on a consistent user experience across various technology platforms and services.[^satybaldy]<br>- The usability of agents and algorithms and other identity system components should be maximazed. User interfaces should allow entities to control, manage, and use their identities intuitively, reliably, and effectively. It should offer a consistent user experience, hide underlying complexity, and should be easy to use.[^cucko] |
| Decentralization and Autonomy | - A self-sovereign identity must support full autonomy on the management and administration of identity information. A user must be fully independent on creating such an identity, as many as required, without relying on any party and be able to update/remove it when she wishes to do so.[^ferdous]<br>- Parties will use their capabilities as they see fit, as they are autonomous (or: self-sovereign, i.e. sovereign over their own knowledge). While they are free to choose whether or not to comply with laws, rules and regulations, they cannot choose the consequences that other parties will attach to their behavior, as these other parties are autonomous as well.[^essif]<br>- An SSI ecosystem shall not require reliance on a centralized system to represent, control, or verify an entity’s digital identity data.[^sovrin]<br>- Entities must have autonomy over, their identity data without relying on any third party.[^cucko] |
| Verifiability and Authenticity | - Any identity should be verifiable through its credentials on the Web in a way similar to a physical credential representing the real world identity. This could be digitally signed by the issuer and cryptographically secured; however, its verification may not necessarily require any interaction with its issuer.[^naik]<br>- Relying parties should be able to verify that digital identities are controlled by their owners or were controlled by their owners when created. Relying parties should receive objective evidence that presented digital identities truthfully characterize their owners, thereby preventing spoofing.[^naik]<br>- An SSI ecosystem shall empower identity rights holders to provide verifiable proof of the authenticity of their digital identity data.[^sovrin]<br>- Claims should be shown to hold true.[^stokkink]<br>- Entities must be able to prove their identity reliably.[^cucko] |
