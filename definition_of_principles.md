# Definition of SSI Principles


| Principle | Definition | Rationale |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Existence ~~and Representation~~ | A Self-Sovereign Identity allows users to digitally encode their attributes, enabling them to establish their existence in the digital realm. By selectively sharing different sets of attributes, users can demonstrate their presence and even construct distinct identities based on various attribute combinations. This ability to manage multiple identities, each defined by a unique set of attributes, is fundamental to self-existence in the digital space. | This definition of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) focuses on existence as the fact of being real. Key points are: 1) Users can digitally encode their characteristics, such as name, age, qualifications, and affiliations. 2) Users can represent themselves in different ways, each of them form a different online identity. The survey result outlins the need for more specification on multiple identities. Finally, the term "Representation" has been removed in favour of a lightened name of the principle; therefore, just "Existence." |
| ~~Ownership and~~ Control | Users must have full control over their digital identity and attributes, serving as the ultimate authority over their own identity. They should always be able to access, update, or conceal their identity as they see fit. To exercise this control, users may act independently or delegate authority to trusted agents and guardians of their choice, such as individuals, organizations, devices, or software. This has led to the emergence of digital agents, like digital wallets, which serve as gatekeepers to a user's digital life. These tools allow users to manage their attributes in a unified manner while retaining full sovereignty over their identity. | The definition emphasizes that users should have full control over their digital identity and attributes. It underscores that individuals should have full authority over their identity and attributes, ensuring they can access, modify, or conceal them at will. Additionally, it acknowledges the practical need for delegation, allowing users to entrust their identity management to trusted agents—whether people, organizations, or digital tools—without compromising control. The inclusion of digital agents, such as wallets, reflects the evolving landscape of SSI, and is confirmed by the result of the survey - more than 50% of respondents use a digital wallet. By refining clarity and flow, this definition balances conceptual depth with real-world applicability. The name "Control" narrows this definition. |
| Access ~~and Availability~~ | Users must have unrestricted access to their own information, as well as to the list of identity and service providers. They should be able to retrieve every piece of information that constitutes their identity, including claims and assertions. This access must be granted without discrimination based on ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, language, or geographic location. | This definition emphasizes the fundamental principle that users must have unrestricted access to all aspects of their identity, including claims and assertions, ensuring full control over their digital presence. Unlike [^toth], who argues that only limited aspects of an individual's identity should be publicly accessible, we assert that individuals should have the right to access and manage their entire identity information without restrictions. The non-discrimination clause reinforces principles of equality, preventing biases based on ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, or language, which could otherwise lead to exclusion or systemic disadvantages. Additionally, the geographical inclusion aspect ensures that users, regardless of their location, are not restricted from accessing essential digital services. This aligns with global data protection principles (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and supports a transparent, user-centric digital ecosystem where individuals maintain control over their information without facing discrimination or accessibility limitations. |
| Transparency | The identity system, along with the algorithms and protocols used for identity management, should be open to ensure transparency in rules, policies, and procedures. Users must have clear visibility into their identities and related interactions. Any identity solution should utilize open systems, protocols, and algorithms that do not depend on specific architectures or proprietary technologies. This guarantees that anyone can examine their operation and understand their impact on decision-making. | This definition emphasizes transparency in identity systems by ensuring that their algorithms and protocols are open and verifiable. Transparency prevents hidden biases and discrimination, allowing independent review to ensure fair application of rules and policies. It also strengthens user rights, ensuring individuals understand how their identities are managed and how decisions affecting them are made. Moreover, open systems enhance security by allowing experts to identify and fix vulnerabilities, reducing risks of fraud or manipulation. Finally, ensuring openness fosters a democratic and inclusive digital infrastructure, preventing control by a single entity and promoting public participation. More than 50% of survey respondents considered transparency as important or very important to study the functioning of the system. |
| Persistence | Identity must persist for as long as users desire, remaining valid even if the identity provider no longer exists. To ensure this, individuals should be able to self-assert attributes and receive attributes from multiple sources. This way, if one provider ceases to exist, the remaining attributes remain valid. At the same time, users retain the right to remove specific operational data from the SSI system. | This definition is influenced by the statements of [^sheldrake] and [^stokkink], who argue that identity should persist indefinitely or at least as long as the user desires. Consequently, we disagree with [^ferdous], who asserts that identity ceases to exist when the asserting authority disappears. To address this, the original set of definitions was refined to clarify how identity persistence can be achieved. The survey further reinforces this position. |
| Portability | Digital identity data must be transferable across platforms, ensuring continuity even if the original platform ceases to exist. This includes the ability to move or copy one’s digital identity data to chosen agents or systems. The transfer should be seamless and free from legal, political, or technological barriers, even in the face of disasters. | This definition emphasizes the importance of digital identity portability across platforms, especially when a platform ceases to exist. It highlights the need for seamless transfer without barriers like legal, political, or technological restrictions, ensuring accessibility even in disaster scenarios. A very important property for a large majority of respondents to the survey. We depart from the literature as our definition does not deal with control and persistency as stated by [^pava][^satybaldy][^allen]. | 
| Interoperability | A self-sovereign identity should be designed for maximum interoperability, ensuring broad accessibility and backward compatibility with legacy identity systems during a transitional period. This allows for seamless interaction between self-sovereign identity systems. | Interoperability in identity systems ensures seamless interaction between different platforms, organizations, and technologies. It allows users to utilize their identity credentials across multiple services without friction, reducing redundancy and enhancing efficiency. This property is moderately important for many respondents and by [^ferdous]. However, differently from [^ferdous] the definition does not focus on the period of time for smoother interoperability and does not mention  open, public, and royalty-free standards.[^toip][^sovrin], nor control [^pava][^allen][^cucko]. | 
| Consent | Users must explicitly consent to the collection, use, and sharing of their personal data with a third party. Furthermore, they should have the ability to withdraw their consent at any time. | Consent aligns with data protection principles, such as those in the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), ensuring that users actively agree to data processing rather than it being assumed or inferred. Additionally, it extended the literature including the ability to opt out at any time and reinforces user rights, preventing organizations from retaining or misusing data without ongoing user consent. |
| Security ~~and protection~~ | Identities must be safeguarded using state-of-the-art security mechanisms and technologies. All identity information should be securely stored and transmitted through protected channels. Priority should be given to censorship-resistant systems that uphold individual rights and freedoms within decentralized environments. | The definition discusses three aspects of security: 1) the use of cutting-edge mechanisms to protect information; 2) the store and transmission through secure channel, and 3) the bias on individuals' freedom against the network needs. Through the survey, only the aspect of credentials was assessed, and many respondents assessed this principle as important. we used a single term for this, as "Security." |
| ~~Privacy and~~ Minimal Disclosure | The disclosure of claims must be minimized as much as possible. Any feature that increases correlation must be strictly controlled with the highest level of granularity. Identity systems should be flexible enough to allow users to share only the essential identity data necessary to achieve their goal. | Minimizing the disclosure of claims (the principle of data minimization) reduces the risk of exposure, identity theft, and unnecessary surveillance. It requires a large intertwine between technology and governance, as raised by the respondents to the survey. We avoid terms such as pseudonimyty as their meaning may change between legal and technical experts.[^gilani] |
| Standard | Identity systems should be built on open standards. Entities must be represented, exchanged, secured, protected, and verified using open, public, and royalty-free standards. | This principle emphasizes that identity systems should rely on open standards to ensure portability, allowing users to move their identities across platforms without vendor lock-in; interoperability, enabling seamless integration and communication between different systems; and persistence, ensuring identities remain valid over time despite technological advancements. Open standards enhance security, promote transparency, and foster a more inclusive digital ecosystem. The majority of respondents are neutral on this point, as we summarized the definition from authors. |
| Cost | The creation, management, and adoption of a self-sovereign identity must not involve hidden costs, licensing fees, or any other financial charges for simply owning an identity. Costs for service provides must be kept to a minimum, ensuring that the benefits of SSI outweigh the expenses. | The principle ensures that crucial operations remain accessible without financial barriers, promoting equity, user adoption, and sustainability. Keeping costs minimal prevents exclusion, maximizes benefits, and supports long-term system efficiency. If costs outweigh benefits, the system risks failure, reduced engagement, and limited innovation. Prioritizing affordability ensures accessibility, fairness, and alignment with public service standards. Despites from our survey, respondents are willing to pay to avoid Adv in the wallet, the importance of minimizing costs is mirrored in the survey. |
| Usability ~~and Consistency~~ | An SSI ecosystem must prioritize user experience by ensuring that agents are highly usable and offer a consistent, intuitive interface. This allows entities to reliably and effectively control, manage, and utilize their identities. Additionally, the system should simplify underlying complexities, making it easy to use. | The rationale for the principle is grounded in accessibility, adoption, and security. First, ease of use is critical for mass adoption; if managing digital identities is too complex, users may struggle to engage effectively or abandon the system altogether. Second, a consistent and intuitive experience builds trust by allowing users to interact with different agents without unnecessary learning curves or frustration. Third, hiding underlying complexity enhances security by reducing the risk of user errors that could lead to identity theft, fraud, or loss of access. Finally, intuitive design empowers users to control their identities confidently, ensuring that the benefits of SSI—such as privacy, self-sovereignty, and interoperability—are fully realized without overwhelming technical barriers. Despites the definitions from authors discuss the recovery from data loss [^andrieu][^naik] and accessiblity[^sovrin], this definition is consistent with the usability of agents and users interfaces. |
| ~~Decentralization and~~ Autonomy | A self-sovereign identity must guarantee complete autonomy in managing and administering identity information. Users should have full autonomy over the creation of their identity and bear sole responsibility for all related operations, without dependence on any third party. | A self-sovereign identity (SSI) must support full autonomy in the management and administration of identity information to ensure user control, privacy, security, and decentralization. Full autonomy enhances privacy by allowing users to decide what information to share, with whom, and for how long, reducing exposure to surveillance and unauthorized data collection. It also strengthens security by minimizing risks of identity theft and fraud, as only the user can authorize transactions or modifications. Furthermore, autonomy fosters portability and interoperability, allowing users to navigate various platforms without being locked into a single provider. The autonomy of identity is sustained by a moderate number of respondents to the survey. |
| Verifiability ~~and Authenticity~~ | An SSI ecosystem must empower identity holders to provide verifiable proof of the authenticity of their digital identity data. At the same time, relying parties should be able to verify this data without direct interaction with the issuers. They must receive objective evidence that the presented digital identities accurately represent their rightful owners. | Verification is the new way to authenticate users and supports decentralized identity.[^hauser] Additionally, relying parties must receive objective evidence that digital identities truthfully characterize their owners to prevent fraud, ensure interoperability, and comply with regulatory requirements. This approach strengthens security while preserving user autonomy and privacy. |
