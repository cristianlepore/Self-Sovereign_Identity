| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Objective (Why)**         | Maximize the utility and adaptability of the network, avoiding bottlenecks or rigidity in the intermediate elements.                                                                                                                                               |

| **Design Principle (DP)**   | *Trust is a relationship between a subject—a person or a group of people—and an object—which can be anything about which the subject needs to make a trust decision.* |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Objective (Why)**         | Define trust as a contextual and relational phenomenon, not merely an internal psychological state.                                                                   |
| **Mechanism (How)**         | Trust occurs when a **subject (individual or group)** evaluates an **object (person, institution, system, technology, information, etc.)** in order to make decisions. |
| **Conditions (Where/When)** | Complex socio-technical contexts in which people must decide whether or not to rely on different objects (e.g., platforms, protocols, smart contracts, authorities).   |
| **Kernel Theories (KT)**    | **KT1: Relational Theory of Trust** – Hardin (2002, *Trust and Trustworthiness*) → trust as a relational concept: *“A trusts B to do X”*.<br> **KT2: Trust in Online Systems** – McKnight, Choudhury & Kacmar (2002); McKnight & Chervany (2010) → trust in digital environments studied as a subject–object relationship (user ↔ system/platform).<br> **KT3: Trust in Human–Technology Interaction** – Lee & See (2004, *Trust in Automation*); Glikson & Woolley (2020, *Human Trust in Artificial Intelligence*) → trust analyzed as a relationship between humans and technological objects (automation, AI). |

| **Design Principle (DP)**   | *While many trust relationships are bi-directional, each direction is independent. In other words, if A trusts B, it does not mean B trusts A.* |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Objective (Why)**         | Clarify that trust is directional and not automatically reciprocal.                                                                                 |

| **How obtained**            | 1. Isolated the focus: **directional, non-symmetric trust**.<br> 2. Linked sociological and psychological bases (Luhmann, Deutsch).<br> 3. Integrated computer science foundations (Blaze et al.) formalizing directionality in digital systems. |

| **Design Principle (DP)**   | *A trust relationship exists in a specific context, and it should not be assumed outside of that context. In other words, if A trusts B in context X, it does not mean A trusts B in context Y.* |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Objective (Why)**         | Highlight that trust is **situated** and cannot be automatically transferred from one context to another.                                                                                       |

| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Objective (Why)**         | Model trust as a **continuous decision-making process** balancing risk and reward.                                                                            |
| **Mechanism (How)**         | Individuals continuously assess risks and benefits → trust emerges when perceived reward exceeds perceived risk, up to a threshold beyond which trust is no longer rational. |
| **Conditions (Where/When)** | Individual and collective decision-making processes, especially under uncertainty or vulnerability (e.g., cybersecurity, financial choices, adoption of new technologies). |
| **Kernel Theories (KT)**    | **KT1: Deutsch (1958, 1973)** – Trust as a choice involving vulnerability and risk vs. benefit (*The Resolution of Conflict*).<br> **KT2: Mayer, Davis & Schoorman (1995)** – *Integrative Model of Organizational Trust*: trust manifests as *risk taking in relationship* when perceived benefit exceeds risk.<br> **KT3: Kahneman & Tversky (1979, 1992)** – *Prospect Theory*: subjective perception of gains and losses creates threshold points where risk outweighs reward.<br> **KT4: Slovic (2000)** – *The Perception of Risk*: cognitive and emotional processes in risk evaluation directly affect trust.<br> **KT5: Pavlou (2003)** – Trust as reduction of risk perception in e-commerce decisions. |

| **Mechanism (How)**         | Trust can propagate along relational chains, but in a **conditional and attenuated** way (not full equivalence, but a “degree of trust”).                                               |
| **Conditions (Where/When)** | Social networks, digital ecosystems, reputation systems, and distributed identity frameworks, where trust is not limited to direct relationships.                                        |

| **Kernel Theories (KT)**    | **KT1: McKnight, Choudhury & Kacmar (2002)** – *Developing and Validating Trust Measures for E-Commerce*: distinguishes **trust in technology** from interpersonal trust, but links them.<br><br> **KT2: Gefen, Karahanna & Straub (2003)** – *Trust and TAM in Online Shopping* (*MISQ*): **trust in the technological artifact** influences interpersonal trust and platform use.<br><br> **KT3: Lankton, McKnight & Tripp (2015)** – *Technology, Humanness, and Trust: Rethinking Trust in Technology*: show that trust in digital artifacts is a prerequisite for adoption.<br><br> **KT4: Söllner, Hoffmann & Leimeister (2016)** – *Why Different Trust Relationships Matter for Information Systems Users*: introduces the autonomous category of **“trust in IT artifacts”**. |
| **How obtained**            | 1. Isolated the key concept: **trust in technology as a prerequisite**.<br>2. Included core references (McKnight, Gefen).<br>3. Added more recent confirmations (Lankton 2015, Söllner 2016) showing empirically the relevance of “trust in IT artifacts.” |

| **How obtained**            | 1. Isolated the key concept: **simplicity = success and resilience**.<br>2. Retained only the most relevant theories (End-to-End, Diffusion, REST).<br>3. Removed generic references (Occam’s razor, KISS) that lack solid theoretical grounding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Objective (Why)**         | Ensure that ToIP protocols and components remain **evolvable** despite constant changes in requirements, networks, and actors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Mechanism (How)**         | Build **extensibility, versioning, forward/backward compatibility**, and **transition plans** directly into the protocol/stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Conditions (Where/When)** | Internet-scale systems, open standards, ecosystems with multiple implementers and frequent evolution cycles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Kernel Theories (KT)**    | **KT1: Extensibility & Versioning** — IETF/IAB: protocols must have native mechanisms to evolve without breaking ([RFC 6709](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6709?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).<br><br> **KT2: Planned Transitions** — lesson from IPv6: gradual transitions must be anticipated ([RFC 5218](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5218?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).<br><br> **KT3: Robustness Principle (revisited)** — excessive tolerance cements errors and blocks evolution ([ACM Queue](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2305856?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). |
| **How obtained**            | Selected only the most directly relevant **IETF/IAB references and the revised Robustness Principle**, as they are directly tied to protocol evolvability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
